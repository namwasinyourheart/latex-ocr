# **Latex OCR: Fine-Tuning Multimodal LLMs for OCR Recognition of Math Formulas from Images**

## ðŸ“– Overview
This project focuses on fine-tuning multimodal large language models (LLMs) such as Qwen, LLaMA, and Paligemma to enhance their ability to perform Optical Character Recognition (OCR) on math formulas from images and convert them into LaTeX equations. The aim is to improve the accuracy and efficiency of extracting mathematical expressions from images and converting them into machine-readable LaTeX format.

## âœ¨ Highlights
- **Fine-tuning multimodal LLMs**: Improving OCR recognition of math formulas from images and their conversion into LaTeX equations.
- **Model Comparison**: Evaluating the performance of LLaMA, Qwen, Paligemma, and other models in OCR-based math formula recognition.
- **Training Optimization**: Using techniques like **LoRA**, **QLoRA**, and **PEFT** for efficient fine-tuning to reduce computational overhead while improving accuracy.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Measuring OCR recognition accuracy and LaTeX conversion quality to ensure the reliability of the recognized math formulas.
